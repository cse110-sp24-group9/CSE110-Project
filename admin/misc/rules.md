## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
**Slack** and **in-person** communication will be the expected lines of communication we expect from all group members, emails will be a last resort if unable to use Slack for what ever reason. We expect everyone to read their Slack/email message **daily** and respond to inquiries within a **timely manner**. 

## Scheduled meetings
We will have two meetings per week, one being the weekly required meeting with the TA, and a second being a weekly breakdown of project progress of all team members. We will have the **project meeting on Fridays** at an undecided time as of now, and the required meeting with the TA has been undecided. If a person is unable to attend a meeting it is expected of them to review the meeting minutes posted within the GitHub repo

## General Responsibilities for All Team Members
1.  Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cse110-sp24-group9) for what is expected to be on the team.

## Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines

## Conflict Resolution
If a conflict arises, we expect team members to bring up this issue to Team leads first, and to work out a resolution local to the team before escalating the conflict to course staff. If you feel like the conflict is bigger than the group, please reach out to the Course or University Staff.
