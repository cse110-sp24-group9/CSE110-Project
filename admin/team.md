## Roster
- [Andrew Pegg](https://andrewcomputsci2019.github.io/CS110-Lab-1/)
  - Hi my name is Andrew and I am a first-year transfer student at UCSD, majoring in Computer Science. Before attending UCSD, I got my A.S. in computer science at MiraCosta College between 2021 and 2023. San Diego has been the place I have called home for the last 14 years, and before that, I have called Florida and Japan home for some smaller amounts of time.
- [Brendon He](https://brendon-he.github.io/CSE110/)
  - I am an 18 year old currently living in the 6th college dorms at UCSD. I often spend my free time reading and playing games with my friends online. While I prefer working and staying inside my room, I am always willing to go out and meet up with others. Otherwise, if you want to find me you may spot me working at the Canyon Vista Marketplace at Warren.
- [Charlie Shang](https://char1iee.github.io/Personal_Pages/)
  - Hello! I’m Charlie Shang, a third-year CS undergrad stuyding at UCSD. My programming experience includes multiple languages, such as python, Java, C, and C++. I completed my first CS project in a summer camp at Tufts University during high school, which is a game demo built by pygame. This experience made me more determined to major in this field and learn more foundational and advanced knowledge about CS. Currently I am one of the undergrad members of cyberlab under SEElab and working on adversarial attacks on machine-learning-based intrusion detection, which applies AI on intrusion detection system to prevent cyber attacks. I am very interested in becoming a researcher and even PHD in the future, and my research interest lies in the application of AI in different domains
- [Drew Lara](https://drewlar.github.io/GitHub-User-Page/)
  - Hello my name is Andrew Lara, I also go by “Drew”, it makes my name shorter and friendly. I am a 2nd year Mathematics-Computer Science Undergradute at UC San Diego.
I am from a small border town in Imperial County CA called Calexico. If you know where that is congrats, not a lot of people do! I lived there my whole life, going to school for the most part in the neigboring city El Centro.
- [Girma Terfa](https://gir-ma.github.io/CSE110-projects-and-lab/#introduction)
  - Hello! I’m Girma Terfa, a computer science student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. My journey into the world of technology began like many others – with a curiosity to understand how the digital realm works and a desire to create something of my own.
- [Henry Tiet](https://henrytiet.github.io/cse110/)
  - Hi, I'm Henry Tiet. I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering Major. I love learning more about software and hardware and am excited to be a part of my team in this class. In my free time, I enjoy working on my bikes and playing video games.
- [Jason Boenjamin](https://jason-boenjamin.github.io/)
  - Hi, I'm Jason Boenjamin, a third-year Computer Science major at UC San Diego. My journey began with childhood inspiration from Iron Man, sparking a passion for AI and robotics that I've pursued into college. I've built servers from scratch and shared my love for tech as a Code Sensei. Also running @626sneaks, I've honed my skills in customer service and online marketing. My academic and entrepreneurial experiences shape my drive to innovate and make a meaningful impact.
- [Jesus Gonzalez](https://jag039.github.io/JesusGonzalez_0721/)
  - Hi, Im Jesus Gonzalez. Im a second year CS major. I am interested in big tech's "top secret" algorithms and their inner workings, as well as software engineering and working on projects in a team setting. Also One piece on top!
- [Kris Chen](https://kriiiiss.github.io/User_page/)
  - Hi, My name is Kris Chen. I am a third year CS student at UC San Diego. For outdoor activities, I like hiking, swimming and surfing. Surfing was one of the best things I ever did at UCSD, and it brought me so much fun. As a programmer, My favorite programming language is python, C++, java. At this moment, I was an undergraduate research assistant in the lab, training models about cybersecurity and attacks. In the future, I am very interested in AI and hope to be an AI engineer.
- [Lance Tran](https://thelancetran.github.io/CSE-110-Lab1/)
  - I'm Lance Tran, a student currently pursuing a degree in Math-CS. Alongside my academic pursuits, I enjoy gaming and exercising, which not only help me unwind but also foster my creativity and resilience. As I continue my educational journey, I'm eager to expand my knowledge and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of Software Engineering.
- [Paul Peng](https://gr33ncamper.github.io/CS110-SP24LAB1/)
  - Hi I’m Paul Peng, a fourth-year Math-CS and Biochemistry major. I’m interested in using software along with mathematics to find solutions to problems our world faces, particularly through the advancement of scientific understanding. In my spare time, I enjoy playing table tennis, learning various trivia, and being outdoors.
