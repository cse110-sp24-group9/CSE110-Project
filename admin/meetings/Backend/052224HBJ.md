## Meetings notes:

After main meeting disbanded, this backend group sorted out how to properly do the testing for the tasklist. Spent a lot of time working together to access the add button as well as use express to run our tests.
Henry made the first test, as well as the layout. Then, Jason and Brendon filled in the ones available. Finally, we created a to do list of tests and disbanded, with the expectation that we will all finish the test this week.

Jason met with front end team to make sure that everything on the backend side aligns with their expectations, and vice versa.
