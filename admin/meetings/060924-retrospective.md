| Backend and frontend working together to tie it all in      |   Had to rewrite eventlist JS a little bit unexpectedly               |  Other external commitments hindered our ability to work on things 
| Being in a call when working |         Learning curve of using indexDB with components        |      Miscommunication led all teams to do way more work than necessary        |
| Communicating as soon as issues arised                            |      Journal entry, eventlist, and tasklist component not saving and storing data the way we wanted to initially      |              |
| Incorporating indexDB to store all data  |  Time constraints due to finals of others           |
