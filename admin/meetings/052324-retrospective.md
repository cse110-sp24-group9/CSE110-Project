| :---------------- | :---------------------|:-------------------|
| Division of work      |   Had to rewrite tasklist JS a little bit unexpectedly               |  Other external commitments hindered our ability to work on things 
| Documentation |         Setting up Express         |      Main design had unintentional modification due to miscommunication        |
| Unit/E2E Testing Components                             |      Testing was delayed due to being unsure if we could use Express, cleared by TA           |              |
| Maintainability, minimalistic approach by using native API's and by using web component for code reusability  |  Had to study for CSE110 midterm           | 
| Making components for Calendar and Tasklist went well |  |
