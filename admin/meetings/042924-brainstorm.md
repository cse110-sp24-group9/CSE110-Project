Agenda

Discussion

- Desktop screens are usually divided into 3 sections
- These desktop layouts divided into 3 windows are basically a spread out version of mobile
- THEREFORE - desktop is the main problem to be focused on right now
- So what do we want
    - calendar
        - select day
        - month overview of activity
            - Emotion? activity? tasks completion?
    - Events
        - Maybe link outside calendars?
        - or simple color coded event
    - Task list
        - Daily tasks
        - Cross day tasks
        - Due dates (automatically adds for every day until completed, but if you complete it, will not keep reminding you on later days)
        - Maybe subdivide tasks into three categories: in-progress, completed, not started
        - Maybe allow user to drag tasks to reassign priorities
- So there is a lot of information on the left side bar. We think the left side bar should include the calendar, then the events, then the tasks on the bottom.
- What to add to the right of calendar?
- Lots of brainstorming
