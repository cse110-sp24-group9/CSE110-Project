## Meeting Notes:  
- **Overall goal (for now)**: want to get a Minimum Value Product (MVP) completed
- Andrew and Lance will get express set up for testing right after this meeting
- Front end: Should be finalizing design decisions
  - Will push Journal Entry Cards & Event List components to main for backend to begin implementing
- Back end: finish up testing -> add extra functionalities & styling (i.e. manipulate user life cycles)
  - Then can move on to more nuanced things like animations
- Clarifications on workflow between front end and backend: 
1. Front end will create HTML and CSS to the level of where they want it to based off of
2. Back end will make them components/add functionality
3. Front end wil take documentation and put all the components together
  
Note about custom components for front end: you guys will be able to easily make changes to styling/rules
  
- By week 8: MVP completed  
- By week 9: Fully functional website
- By week 10: Data Persistence

## Final Thoughts & Questions:

- for the editor: pull in a library for ease
