### Design Talk

- Look at apps
    - Apple Calendar:
        - Has time ‘zoom out’ feature, can select previous years
    - Leet Code:
        - back to today button → go back to today
        - marked what days were interacted with in calendar
        - streak with emotion / journaling? ← positive feed back
        - Computer UI:
            - Different sections
            - Different Sizes / resizing
            - Dynamic Sizing
    - Notion Calendar:
        - Computer UI:
            - Click Left Bar → calendar
            - Number of days to view
        - Phone UI:
            - Swipe up for adding eventing → perhaps turn into a task list swipe up
            - Swipe right for calendar options
            - click on month to look at month view (also a swipe down)
                - No year view
                - year only goes back to 2022 (Should the user having a boundary time?)
                - Had no months view (had to swipe to look at previous months / years)
            

### Next Steps

- Start drawing out
- Choose and idea, tinker with idea separately
- Combine features to get into a draft
