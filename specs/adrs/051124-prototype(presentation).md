# Prototype - Layout of the Calendar, task list, and journal on screen

## Context and Problem Statement

Given the wide range of design possibilities, we've decided to focus on prototyping and finalizing a single layout for our app. This allows our design team to seamlessly move forward to the next stage. 

## Considered Options

* Grid view
* colomn separated
* Layouts
* resizable colomns
* legend
  

### Pros and Cons

* Pros
  * Easy for design team to build upon
  * Readablity and easy for users
  * Simplifies elements for abstraction
  * Majority of browsers support Web Components
* Cons
  *  May appear differently on mobile phones due to varying screen sizes and resolutions
  *  Additional effort required to create alternative layouts for smaller screens
