# Testing -> JEST

## Context and Problem Statement

As our team progressively implements different functionalities for our project, we want to have a tool we can use to easily build tests for said functionalities.

## Considered Options

* JEST
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

### Pros and Cons

* Pros
  * All members will have learned / become familiar with in Lab 6
  * Well Documented
  * Ease of integration
* Cons
  * May not integrate seamlessly with non-JavaScript libraries or frameworks
  * Can be slow if test suites grow too large
